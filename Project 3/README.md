## Overview:

We created an application that simulated a two wheel vehicle with sensors in the front. We also had a light source where the "car" needed to move towards. The light beam had a light sensitivity and sensor output depended on how far away it was from the light source.

The function that represented this was S1- 100 / 10 = 10 if the sensor S1 is 10 pixels away from the light source and the intensity of the light source is 100.

The relationship between the wheel moving speed and sensor inputs were given by a matrix; in the handout.
